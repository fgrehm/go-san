Parse Stochastic Automata Network models described in the format supported by
the [PEPS Tool](http://www-id.imag.fr/Logiciels/peps/userguide.html#Model_Description)
in Go.

## Credits

Most of the parser code was based off of HashiCorp's [hcl](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl)
so thanks to everyone that contributed to that project.
